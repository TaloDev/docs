# Players and props

## Accessing players

<ScopeBadges scope='players' read />

After identifying a player, you can access the underlying player object using `Talo.CurrentPlayer`. For the current player alias, you can use `Talo.CurrentAlias`.

You can also find a player by their ID using `Talo.Players.Find()`. Players retrieved this way are read-only: you can only modify or take actions on behalf of a player that was previously identified.

## Searching for players

<ScopeBadges scope='players' read />

You can use `Talo.Players.Search()` to query players. This function accepts a single `query` parameter that will search your playerbase for matching player IDs, alias identifiers or prop values. You can use this function to find players by their username, their ID or if they have a prop with a specific value.

```csharp
private async void SearchPlayers()
{
    try
    {
        var searchPage = await Talo.Players.Search("bob");
        if (searchPage.count == 0)
        {
            Debug.Log("No players found");
            return;
        }

        var identifiers = new List<string>();
        foreach (var player in searchPage.players)
        {
            identifiers.Add(player.GetAlias().identifier);
        }

        Debug.Log($"Found {searchPage.count} results: {string.Join(", ", identifiers)}");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Debug.LogError($"Search failed: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

## Getting and setting props

Players can have a list of arbitrary properties that are persisted across all of their aliases. These props are identified by their unique key and can have any string value.

### Getting props

You can retrieve the current player's props using `Talo.CurrentPlayer.props`. To retrieve a single prop use `Talo.CurrentPlayer.GetProp()` (where you can also specify a fallback).

### Setting props

<ScopeBadges scope='players' write />

You can set props using `Talo.CurrentPlayer.SetProp()`. If a prop with specified key doesn't exist it'll be created, otherwise the existing prop with the same key will be updated.

:::warning
Player props are not linearisable - simultaneous requests may be applied out of order. You should avoid setting or deleting props in `Update()` functions.
:::

### Deleting props

<ScopeBadges scope='players' write />

Props can be deleted with `Talo.CurrentPlayer.DeleteProp()` or by using `Talo.CurrentPlayer.SetProp()` and setting the value to `null`.
