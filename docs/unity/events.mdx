# Events

Events let you better understand what players are doing and can be useful for putting together a timeline of events for debugging.

Check out this blog post on [how to track events in Unity](https://trytalo.com/blog/event-tracking-unity?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=tip) for a detailed walkthrough

## Tracking

<ScopeBadges scope='events' write />

To track an event, simply call `Talo.Events.Track()` with an event name like "Level up". You can optionally attach properties to events by passing any number of extra `(string, string)` tuples to the function call:

```csharp title="TrackLevelUpEvent.cs"
private void LevelUp()
{
	level++;

	Talo.Events.Track(
		"Level up",
		("newLevel", $"{level}"),
		("timeTaken", $"{timeTaken}")
	);

	timeTaken = 0;
}
```

## Flushing

Events are sent off in batches to prevent issues around rate limiting or using too much of your player's bandwidth. You can manually call `Talo.events.flush()` to send off the events currently waiting in the queue. Flushing also happens automatically when:

1. The game loses focus
2. The game is paused
3. The game is closed
4. In WebGL builds, after the time in seconds defined in the `webGLEventFlushRate` setting has elapsed. Unity doesn't implement the `OnApplicationQuit` function for WebGL builds and as a result event tracking is slightly more unreliable. You can increase or decrease the `webGLEventFlushRate` but be wary of the reasons why events are batched described above.

## Meta props

Talo sends through some extra props with each event. These props are made up of the following metadata:

- The player's operating system
- The version of the game
- The window mode (fullscreen, fullscreen windowed, maximized window or windowed)
- The width of the game window
- The height of the game window

These properties are then attached as props to the player, providing you with extra tools for debugging possible bugs and configurations where they appear.
