# Events

Events let you better understand what players are doing and can be useful for putting together a timeline of events for debugging.

## Tracking

<ScopeBadges scope='events' write />

To track an event, simply call `Talo.events.track()` with an event name like "Level up". You can optionally attach properties to events by passing a dictionary to the function call:

```gdscript title="level_up_button.gd"
extends Button

var level := 1

func _on_pressed() -> void:
	level += 1

	Talo.events.track("Level up", {
		"New level": level
	})
```

## Flushing

Events are sent off in batches to prevent issues around rate limiting or using too much of your player's bandwidth. You can manually call `Talo.events.flush()` to send off the events currently waiting in the queue. Flushing also happens automatically when:

1. The game loses focus
2. The game is paused
3. The game is closed

## Meta props

Talo sends through some extra props with each event. These props are made up of the following metadata:

- The player's operating system
- The version of the game
- The window mode (fullscreen, fullscreen windowed, maximized window or windowed)
- The width of the game window
- The height of the game window

These properties are then attached as props to the player, providing you with extra tools for debugging possible bugs and configurations where they appear.
