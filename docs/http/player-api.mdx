# Player API

Talo provides a powerful and secure authentication system out of the box. You can use Talo to authenticate players using their email, username, or any other identifier you choose.

Players can have any number of arbitrary properties that will persist between game sessions and all of their identities. You can use these, for example, to store a player's current health or level.
