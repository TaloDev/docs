Talo provides a secure socket system for real-time communication between your game and players. The Talo Socket is the underlying server that powers services like [channels](https://trytalo.com/channels) and handles connections, messages and events.

To connect to the socket server, you need to obtain a socket ticket. Learn more about socket authentication [here](/docs/sockets/intro#authentication).
