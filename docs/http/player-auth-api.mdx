Talo provides a powerful and secure authentication system out of the box. You can use Talo to authenticate players using their email, username, or any other identifier you choose.

Learn more about player authentication [here](https://trytalo.com/players#authentication?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=api-docs).

## Identifying players using Talo Authentication

Once you have registered a player, you can identify them using the [identify](/docs/http/player-api) endpoint. You will need to ensure that:

1. The `identifier` is the one you used to register the player (email, username, etc.)
2. The `service` is set to `talo`
3. The `x-talo-session` header contains the session token you received from the login/register endpoint

To create a new session token, you will need to go through the login flow again for the player.
