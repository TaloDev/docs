# Game config API

Talo's live config allows you to configure your game directly in the dashboard. Your game can then fetch this config on-demand, allowing your game and players to have the latest information without downloading a new update.

Live config runs on a collection of key-value pairs. For example, you could have a key of "maxLevel" which has value of "10". While running a beta test you can incrementally increase this maximum level to allow access to more content at your own pace.
